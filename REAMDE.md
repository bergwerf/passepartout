Simple passe-partout creator
============================
This is a web-based tool to add a passe-partout around a photo uploaded from
your device. The idea for this tool was proposed by my friend Rama. Existing
tools often overlay the frame on the picture, which is not the desired effect.
There are two parameters: the background color, and the new size as a percentage
relative to either the width or height of the photo. The tool does not generate
a preview on purpose. The interface is either English or Dutch based on the
navigator language.
